### Project Overview
I have been tasked by The Disaster Reporting Network to generate an interactive map to populate recent earthquake data. My end goal was to allow 3 different map styles, while also having providing the viewer the option to view or hide Tectonic Plates, Earthquakes, and Major Earthquakes.
This was achieved by utilizing:
- Javascript
-  D3
-  Mapbox
-  Leaflet

### Map Features
The below shows the end result in a satellite view, with tectonic plates, earthquakes, and major earthquakes selected.

The below images show both the selectable options to modify your view, as well as the legend to identify the earthquakes intensity.
