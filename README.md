### Project Overview
I have been tasked by The Disaster Reporting Network to generate an interactive map to populate recent earthquake data. My end goal was to allow 3 different map styles, while also having providing the viewer the option to view or hide Tectonic Plates, Earthquakes, and Major Earthquakes.
This was achieved by utilizing:
- Javascript
-  D3
-  Mapbox
-  Leaflet
